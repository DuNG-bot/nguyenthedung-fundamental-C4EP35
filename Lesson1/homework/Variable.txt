- To check a variable's type: type()
- SYTAX RULES for variable's name:
    + Only begin with an underscore or a letter
    + Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
    + Can not use Python keywords
=> You will get SYNTAX ERROR from the compiler for having invalid names when you're not obeying the rules above
- Examples of invalid names:
