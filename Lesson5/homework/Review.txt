- We use function to organize program into chunks that are easier to understand
- To declare a function, we need to have:
   + a header line which begins with a keyword 'def' and ends with a colon
   + a body consisting of one or more Python statements, indented the same amount from the header line
- To call a function, we use the NAME of that function along with parenthesis, include parameters if stated
- Return function save the results after executed by the function. Return also is a way to exit the function without having to execute the rest of the code
- We only need to use return when inside a fruitful function (function with values)
- Arguments are the list of values through which the function will execute. These arguments are assigned to the parameters in the function definition
- To use function from a different file, we use:
from FILE NAME import FUNCTION
