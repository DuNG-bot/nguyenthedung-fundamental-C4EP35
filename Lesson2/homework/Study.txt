1. A Boolean value is either true or false. It is the basis of all modern computer logic.
Examples: 3**(0.5) < 2
          "Hello" != "Hi"
          "Mind" + "X" == "MindX"
3. Nested conditionals is when the statement of one branch of condition contains another condition (if statement)

Example:
Y = int(input('Enter your birth year: '))
age = 2019 - Y

if age < 13:
    print('Baby')
else:
    if age < 18:
        print('Teen')
    else:
        print('Adult')
